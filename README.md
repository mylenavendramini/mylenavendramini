## Skills:

## Main Projects (completed):

[This Author](https://this-author.netlify.app/):
**React | JavaScript**

My first website using React. With this project, I put into practice everything I learned about components, hooks, roots and much more. The site is a display of a writer's books and biography. Using React was a good choice to show a page with all the books, another with some categories and another one with the book itself.

[Projects List](https://github.com/mylenavendramini/Projects-List): 
**Typescript**

A simple application where you can interact with the page, adding projects to the list and dragging them from one box to another.

[Toda Cidad√£](https://todacidada.com/): 
**React | JavaScript**

An intuitive and easily accessible website of an NGO (Toda Cidad√£), which I developed from scratch and am constantly maintaining.

## Projects (on going):
[Gym app](https://github.com/mylenavendramini/gym-app): **React | Typescript**

An application where the user can choose a ready-made workout or include it own exercises. In both options, it can set the repetitions, weight and intervals and then send via email.

[Javascript Quiz](https://javascript-quiz-mv.netlify.app/): **React | Typescript**
